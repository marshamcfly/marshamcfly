## 👽🖖🏾 Welcome to the Digital Dojo 🖖🏾👽

This is where my Python journey begins - the place where I sharpen my tools, log my grind, and build my way into the future I own. 

## 🧠 What’s This About?

This is my **Python foundation arc**, powered by:
- 🐍 *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*
- 🧱 Hands-on projects and scripts
- 🚀 A 6-month roadmap toward blockchain security, AI automation, and remote freedom

## 🥋 Current Focus

- Learning Python with *Automate the Boring Stuff*  
- Committing every lesson to GitHub  
- Logging every move in Notion  
- Building toward a smart contract security MVP

## 📖 Lesson Progress

| Lesson | Focus                        | Status        |
|--------|------------------------------|---------------|
| 1      | Variables, Math, Output      | ✅ Complete   |
| 2      | `if`, `else`, Flow Control   | 🔜 In Progress |
| 3      | Loops + Functions            | ⏳ Queued      |

## 🧰 Tools of the Trade

- Python 3.13
- VS Code
- GitHub
- Notion
- Grit & Consistency

## 💁🏾‍♀️ Why I Build

Because freedom is worth the fight.
Because I’m not built for scripts and headsets.
Because builders build.

Follow along if you're on a similar path.  
We don’t quit. We deploy.
